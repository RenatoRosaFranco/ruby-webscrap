207920,6178,"Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc.","<p>The History of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc. Since it's founding on December 4, 1906, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. has supplied voice and vision to the struggle of African-Americans and people of color around the world. Alpha Phi Alpha, the first intercollegiate Greek-letter fraternity established for African-Americans, was founded at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York by seven college men who recognized the need for a strong bond of Brotherhood among African descendants in this country. The visionary founders, known as the &ldquo;Jewels&rdquo; of the Fraternity, are Henry Arthur Callis, Charles Henry Chapman, Eugene Kinckle Jones, George Biddle Kelley, Nathaniel Allison Murray, Robert Harold Ogle, and Vertner Woodson Tandy. The Fraternity initially served as a study and support group for minority students who faced racial prejudice, both educationally and socially, at Cornell. The Jewel founders and early leaders of the Fraternity suc-ceeded in laying a firm foundation for Alpha Phi Alpha's principles of scholarship, fellowship, good character, and the uplifting of humanity. Alpha Phi Alpha chapters were established at other colleges and universities, many of them historically black institutions, soon after the founding at Cornell. The first Alumni Chapter was established in 1911. While continuing to stress academic excellence among its members, Alpha also recognized the need to help correct the educational, economic, political, and social injustices faced by African-Americans. True to its form as the &ldquo;first of firsts,&rdquo; Alpha Phi Alpha has been interracial since 1945.</p>",fiualphas@gmail.com,Active,Public,N/A,https://www.instagram.com/fiualphas/?hl=en,http://facebook.com/fiualphas,http://twitter.com/FIUALPHAS

<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>Ethical and effective leadership is defined by the quality of the choices leaders make for themselves, their organizations and the communities they serve.&nbsp;<strong>The Center for Leadership&nbsp;</strong>at&nbsp;<strong>Florida International University&nbsp;</strong>understands that for leaders to position themselves to make better decisions more often, the process of leadership development should be continuous and intentional. Over time, what also should develop is a personal leadership philosophy, a deeper understanding of self and a repertoire of competencies consistent with effective leadership outcomes.</p>
<p>Effective leadership is evidenced and defined by behavior and action &ndash; it&rsquo;s not about &ldquo;being&rdquo; a leader, but &ldquo;doing leadership well.&rdquo; The Center&rsquo;s model for leadership development, then, focuses on two epicenters: self-insight and developable skills.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""x_x_x_x_row"">
<div class=""x_x_x_x_small-12 x_x_x_x_columns"">
<ul>
<li><strong>Self-Insight:&nbsp;</strong>To be most effective a leader must first begin to look inward and be prepared to take a deep dive into who they are, how they think, how they view the world, and to question the basis for these perceptions. While it is unlikely that an individual may be able to change these more core characteristics, deep self-awareness can help leaders proactively manage leadership behaviors.</li>
<li><strong>Leadership skills:&nbsp;</strong>The application of cutting-edge research vetted by leading practitioners allows leaders to learn, practice and develop actionable skills and behaviors consistent with effective leadership.</li>
</ul>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Center for Leadership</strong>&nbsp;faculty and staff are dedicated to exploring leadership thought and practice through continuous research, providing opportunities for leaders to develop keen self-insight, and teaching leadership competencies that will equip them to meaningfully transform their organizations and their societies. Through research, executive development programs and community engagement opportunities, the&nbsp;<strong>Center for Leadership&nbsp;</strong>is committed to equipping&nbsp;<strong><em>better leaders&nbsp;</em></strong>for a&nbsp;<strong><em>better world</em></strong>.</p>
<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>To provide leadership development that transforms and emboldens individuals and organizations to positively impact our world.</p>

377807,6178,Discipline-Based Education Research (DBER) Alliance,"<p>Discipline-Based Education Research (DBER) is the collective methods, theories, and models that examine teaching and learning within science disciplines. The Discipline-Based Education Research Alliance (DBER-A) is an inclusive term used to emphasize the interdisciplinary nature of this DBER and calls for an alliance of the disciplines to exchange resources and act as supportive structures for DBER students and researchers (Henderson, 2017). This alliance also serves as a community of practice for DBER researchers. ""Communities of practice are groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly"" (Wenger-Trayner, 2015). We do not expect that there may be challenges (Talanquer, 2014) but are optimistic that combining resources and expertise will be of great value to FIU's DBER students. The DBER student organization aims to address concerns faced by all DBER students, regardless of the discipline. These challenges include but are not limited to the following:<br />Institutional and Departmental Support for DBER Students: DBER is Interdisciplinary, with Variability Across DBER Programs and professional challenges for DBER Students. This organization is not meant to diminish the intricacies between the disciplines but to supplement and complement their students' and researchers' shared resources and experiences and is open to all education researchers at FIU.</p>
<p>The DBER student organization envisions creating an environment where students have the capital and agency to advocate for their needs, advance and progress academically and professionally, and succeed in their DBER program of study. The DBER student organization will instill students with academic resources to progress in their DBER program through collaboration, community building, resource sharing and exchange, and developing a repository of academic and professional resources for DBER students.<br />The goal of DBER-A is to strengthen, maintain, and sustain FIU&rsquo;s DBER programs of study across disciplines, provide academic, research, and professional resources to DBER students, and provide opportunities for community building, mentorship, network building, and interdisciplinary collaboration.</p>
<p>While BER, CER, EER, and PER comprise most of the DBER work at FIU, research interests, scope, and methodology vary. DBER students and labs study populations along the K-20 continuum in formal and informal settings. Research scope may include teaching and learning at levels of analysis that include research, policy, and practice. DBER students have studied science literacy, student reflective practices, mentorship models, and student affect, such as motivation, identity, agency, capital, resilience, sense-making, and sense of belonging. At this time, Florida International University does not have an astronomy or geoscience education research lab, but we welcome the participation of students interested in AER.</p>",awrig019@fiu.edu,Active,Public,https://sites.google.com/view/dber-afiu/home,N/A,N/A,N/A

Panther Bionics was established by the persistent and constant need to&nbsp; integrate and join different disciplines in engineering , similar to a company which incorporates the use of all of its workers skills to complete tasks while simultaneously improving different aspects in which the worker may not excel in .&nbsp; The organization aims to inspire, educate and empower student members by creating an environment that promotes creativity, innovation, and vision. The Multidisciplinary Engineering fields include biomedical engineering , mechanical engineering , electrical engineering , computer science and computer engineering and many more. Panther Bionics looks to bring all STEAM disciplines together to show the students how important each area (i.e. Music, Architecture, Math) can be to medical technology innovation. Multidisciplinary collaboration enables the students to work in teams to tackle the complex layers of&nbsp; engineering projects , accelerates development of knowledge, skills, networks, and experiences to prepare its members for their future careers. The main objective of Panther Bionics is to engage undergraduate student members in problem solving and design activities , similar to the senior design concepts ,&nbsp; throughout the year, and complete engineering- based projects that could potentially be presented at national and international competitions.&nbsp; The educational components of the organization encompass learning and practicing translational research techniques, acquiring industry related skills such as design and prototyping, quality control and testing procedures, and more.&nbsp; It also aids in helping students gain more exposure&nbsp; to and experience in their respective fields before entering the work-place in the form of volunteering , outreach events and possible internships and career building activities such as workshops. Panther Bionics proposes a structured platform to educate the student body about the critical ""bedside to bench to bedside"" approach to Biomedical innovation which incorporates the use of all disciplines in engineering . This approach is a repeating loop of research-based medical care, in which clinical (bedside) observations stimulate research efforts (bench), which leads back to the bedside for implementation and further clinical discovery. Panther Bionics will act as a stepping stone for students to take their efforts to the next level by establishing a link with industry partners.&nbsp; Panther Bionics will also aid in students gaining leadership and public speaking experience as students will essentially be put into teams to complete different tasks.</p>",pantherbionics@gmail.com,Active,Public,https://bme.fiu.edu/academics/student-resources/student-societies/panther-bionics-2,https://www.instagram.com/pantherbionics/,N/A,N/A

208405,6178,Phi Delta Phi,"Phi Delta Phi©® is the oldest legal organization in continuous existence in the United States, predating even the American Bar Association. It was founded in 1869 at the University of Michigan School of Law by four law students, who at the urging of their faculty, endeavored to create an association that would foster scholarship, civility, and ethical conduct in our profession. Since that time, Phi Delta Phi©® has grown beyond the borders of the United States to Canada, Latin America and Europe.
 
Phi Delta Phi©® celebrates academic excellence and embraces the finest attributes of professionalism and scholarship. Since our founding, Phi Delta Phi©® has emphasized to students and lawyers alike the importance of our calling. Our active membership is drawn from those students of the law who not only have shown themselves companionable, but have manifested ability and industry in legal study. Similar to membership in Phi Beta Kappa in the undergraduate colleges and universities, membership in Phi Delta Phi©® is a mark of honor and distinction that follows one throughout life.
 
Academic achievement alone is not sufficient to give rise to an invitation to join Phi Delta Phi©®. Integrity, service, and excellence in all facets of human experience are considered factors for membership. In the words of our Phi Delta Phi©® forefathers, we intend that those so selected shall lead the legal profession. Once accepted, a member of Phi Delta Phi will be recognized as one whose moral compass, academic ability, and personal integrity is beyond reproach.

<p>CHARACTER</p>
<p>A wise man once said, you are judged by the company you keep. You can be certain that with Pi Kappa Phi, you are in good company. We share more than a house or greek letters but principled behavior and values. You can own the courage to stand up for your beliefs and act upon your morals and convictions. For Pi Kappa Phi these values are not only encouraged &ndash; it is an obligation of our membership.</p>
<p>Every member of Pi Kappa Phi is expected to:</p>
<p>&middot; Forbid hazing in any form.</p>
<p>&middot; Exhibit ultimate respect for each individual brother.</p>
<p>&middot; Act responsibly in every situation.</p>
<p>&middot; Be confident in what he believes and have courage to stand up for what is right.</p>
<p>LEADERSHIP</p>
<p>A college education is more than just attending classes. Some of the greatest lessons you will learn are from the leadership opportunities outside the classroom. With Pi Kappa Phi you will experience the best in leadership and personal development with opportunities ranging from corporate-level leadership training to leadership through service, Pi Kapps gain valuable real-world experience.</p>
<p>ACHIEVEMENT</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not only the feeling of winning Homecoming or capturing first place in an intramural championship game. Achievement is about selfless contribution towards a noble cause. Winning is not as important as being able to shake your opponent&rsquo;s hand after the match. Integrity and determination are the skills and traits needed to become a better student, leader, citizen, and fraternity man.</p>
<p>SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>College isn&rsquo;t easy. Juggling chapter meetings, spending time with friends, and finding time to study is no easy task. That&rsquo;s why Pi Kappa Phi provides its members with an Academic Coach &ndash; a faculty member paid and trained by the National Headquarters to be your academic resource. Intellectual growth is important to Pi Kappa Phi and our opportunities are meant to help you reach your academic potential.</p>
<p>SERVICE</p>

It was this pioneering spirit that led us to the creation of a one of a kind philanthropy &ndash; Push America. Since 1977, Push America&rsquo;s mission has been to improve the lives of people with disabilities. Pi Kappa Phi remains the only fraternity to create and maintain its own national philanthropy. The Journey of Hope is the single largest fraternity fund-raising event.

RHA assists the Department of Housing and Residential Experience in fostering the educational and social pursuit of a diverse student population, and represents them to the community at large. RHA offers unique opportunities for student growth and development, as well as leadership experiences through programming and other student-related activities. All students who live on campus at FIU-MMC are considered RHA members and are encouraged to get involved!</p>
<p>Within RHA, each residential community hosts a Hall or Community Council. The RHA Councils are the student government bodies for a specific residential community. These Councils represent the voice of the residents of its community, advocates for their needs, and provides student input. RHA Councils facilitate and support quality programs and service events for the residents in the building. They also provide residents with opportunities for leadership development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through involvement in RHA Councils, students learn how to be active members of a community, how to advocate for themselves and others, and how to affect change in their community. They develop leadership skills, gain a sense of belonging and importance, grow personally, and learn about self-authorship. RHA Councils can be an essential tool in teaching students how to become future engaged citizens and leaders.</p>
<p>RHA supports its sister organization, the National Residence Hall Honorary (or NRHH). NRHH is the only national organization that exclusively recognizes leaders within residence halls. It is also considered the recognition branch for the national student housing organization known as the National Association of College and University Residence Halls, Inc. (or NACURH).
